Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in the United States. Doombox recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:</p><ul class="mb-5 text-base md:text-lg leading-9 md:leading-10 list-disc pl-5"><li class="mb-5">Right to Know. You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.</li><li class="mb-5">Right of Access. This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.</li><li class="mb-5">Right to Correction. You have the right to request correction of your personal information.</li><li class="mb-5">Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”. This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using Doombox services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li><li class="mb-5">Right to Complain. You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to <a class="text-wisteria" href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</li><li class="mb-5">Right to Restrict Processing. This is your right to request the restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of the sale of personal information. (Again: We never have and never will sell your personal data.)</li><li class="mb-5">Right to Object. You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.</li><li class="mb-5">Right to Portability. You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.</li><li class="mb-5">Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making. You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li><li class="mb-5">Right to Non-Discrimination. This right stems from the CCPA. We do and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.</li></ul><p class="mb-10 text-base md:text-lg leading-9 md:leading-10">Many of these rights can be exercised by contacting us at <a class="text-wisteria" href="mailto:doombox.app@gmail.com">doombox.app@gmail.com</a> and in the future by signing in and directly updating your account information.<br/><br/>To identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR, EU individuals should go to <a class="text-wisteria" href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</p></div><div><h3 class="font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield policy</h3><p class="mb-5 text-base md:text-lg leading-9 md:leading-10">The GDPR requires that data transfer out of the EU must only happen to countries deemed as having adequate data protection laws. The United States generally doesn&#x27;t meet that requirement. Privacy Shield is an agreement between certain European jurisdictions and the United States that allows for the transfer of personal data from the EU to the US. Participation in the Privacy Shield program is voluntary.<br/><br/>We comply with the frameworks for EU, UK, and Swiss data that are transferred into the United States.<br/><br/>Doombox complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. We&#x27;ve certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles take precedent. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a class="text-wisteria" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.<br/><br/>Doombox is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with regard to the Privacy Shield Frameworks.<br/><br/>The Privacy Shield Frameworks uphold specific principles, many of which are already outlined in the section on Your Rights. For clarity, pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, the following principles apply to all EU, UK and Swiss data that has been transferred into the United States:</p><ul class="mb-10 text-base md:text-lg leading-9 md:leading-10 list-disc pl-5"><li class="mb-5">You have the right to access your personal data and to update, correct and/or amend information that is incomplete. You also have the right to request erasure of personal information that has been processed in violation of the principles. If you wish to exercise these rights, you may do so by signing in and directly updating your account information. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at <a class="text-wisteria" href="mailto:doombox.app@gmail.com">doombox.app@gmail.com</a></li><li class="mb-5">We remain liable for the onward transfer of personal data to third parties acting as our agents, unless we can prove we were not a party to the events giving rise to the damages.</li><li class="mb-5">We do not sell personal data nor do we permit it to be used for reasons other than those for which it was originally provided. If this practice should change in the future, we will update this policy accordingly and provide you with opt-out or opt-in choice as appropriate.</li><li class="mb-5">We may be required to release personal data in response to lawful requests from public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.</li></ul></div><div><h3 class="font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">We commit to resolving all complaints</h3><p class="mb-10 text-base md:text-lg leading-9 md:leading-10">In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolving complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union, United Kingdom, or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact <a class="text-wisteria" href="mailto:doombox.app@gmail.com">doombox.app@gmail.com</a>.<br/><br/>Doombox has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by BBB National Programs.

This service is provided at no cost to you. Please do not submit GDPR complaints to BBB EU Privacy Shield.<br/><br/>If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.
