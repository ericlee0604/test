That means when it comes to security, privacy, and customer support, we will continue to maintain any legacy Services. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.</li><li class="mb-5">Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers.

That means we process any data you share with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We do not retain, use, disclose or sell any of that information for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit permission.
